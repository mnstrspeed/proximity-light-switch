proximity-light-switch
======================
Turn your phone's proximity sensor into a light switch for your Philips Hue setup.

The light switch is operated by swiping your hand over your phone while it's connected to AC/USB power (to save 
battery and to avoid accidental triggers while you're going about your day).
